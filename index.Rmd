FECR is an R package designed to implement and update several Fecal Egg Count Reduction Test methods.

To install this package, you can rely on the `devtools` or `renv` packages as follow:
```{r install,eval=FALSE}
# with devtools installed:
devtools::install_github("R-KenK/FECR")

# with renv installed:
renv::install("R-KenK/FECR")

```
  
This website is currently in construction, and the package itself is still evolving pretty quickly.  

Stay tuned for more!
